		  <li>Word mark
		  <p>The name "FocusBuddies" consists of two words that perfectly encapsulate what
		  our primary service is: "Focus", which reflects the productivity and time-tracking
		  aspect of our service, and "Buddies", which reflects the communal part, the shared
		  tracking and sense of responsibility the sharing brings. Together they encapsulate 
		  our brand perfectly.

		  Products), Class 42 (Computer and Software Services and Scientific Services)</p>
		  </li>
		  <li>Symbol mark
		  <p>The circular logo featuring the letter "f" for focus and a stick figure representing a "buddy",
		  which was freely downloaded from <a href="https://www.vecteezy.com/?utm_source=vecteezy-download&utm_medium=license-info-pdf&utm_campaign=license-info-document" class="text">vecteezy.com</a>
		  and is as such used under the listed license, that allows for use as long as they are credited by linking where possible. They are also credited in the alt caption of the logo.
		  Using both of the "initials" of our service, "fb", was deemed risky since they are widely interpreted as a very popular social media abbreviation. Hence a more visual approach was taken. The placement
		  of the logo itself is very flexible.

		  </li>
		  <li>Color mark
		  <p>The colors #6d28d9 and #ede9fe are used to highlight and to bring the design to a new level, however, for accessibility reasons, they are not the only things highlighting and focusing.
		  We are in no way claiming our right over the use of these colors and we are not using any colors that have been trademarked.
