		  <li>Word mark: FocusBuddies
		  <p>The name "FocusBuddies" consists of two words that perfectly show what
		  our primary service is: "Focus", which reflects the productivity and time-tracking
		  aspect of our service, and "Buddies", which reflects the communal part, the shared
		  tracking and sense of responsibility the sharing brings. Together they encapsulate 
		  our brand perfectly.

		  </li>
		  <li>Word mark: PlanShare
		  <p>
			  "PlanShare" is used to identify a feature within
			  the FocusBuddies platform, currently available to pro customers only. The name combines the terms "Plan", to 
			  repeat that it is focused on productivity and plans, and "Share", to signify the integration of shared plans and calendars.
			  The PlanShare feature allows users to create
			  shared schedules, synchronize calendars with focusbuddies,
			  and vote on plans or time slots.

		  <li>Symbol mark
		  <p>The circular logo featuring the letter "f" for focus and a stick figure representing a "buddy",
		  which was freely downloaded from <a href="https://www.vecteezy.com/?utm_source=vecteezy-download&utm_medium=license-info-pdf&utm_campaign=license-info-document" class="text">vecteezy.com</a>
		  and is as such used under the listed license, that allows for use as long as they are credited by linking where possible. They are also credited in the alt caption of the logo.
		  Using both of the "initials" of our service, "fb", was deemed risky since they are widely interpreted as a very popular social media abbreviation. Hence a more visual approach was taken. The placement
		  of the logo itself is very flexible.

		  </li>
		  <li>Color mark
		  <p>The colors #6d28d9 and #ede9fe are used consistently throughout the user
          interface to highlight interactive elements and create a calm visual
          hierarchy. For accessibility reasons, color is never the sole means of
          conveying information.
		  We are in no way claiming our right over the use of these colors and we are not using any colors that have been trademarked.
